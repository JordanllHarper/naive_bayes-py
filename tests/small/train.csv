"Subject: altos na gas model  kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term  natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that  the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america  should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,  in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .  pipeline grid .  as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale  nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and  one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed  that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and  testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the  software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the  one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription  price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other  details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still  need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to  proceed with the test .  with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be  responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is  pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in  ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key  role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately  be made by the new project team .  i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it  has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the  "" affiliate "" issues ) .  let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .  jng",0
